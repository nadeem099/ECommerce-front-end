# ECommerce-front-end
This is a codebase for a t-shirt selling website developed using Reactjs. It's backend is built using django rest framework. Find the backend codebase [here](https://github.com/nadeem099/Ecommerce-back-end).

## Overview
Reactjs is a powerful front end library to build front end UI of web apps. In order to get started you need to know HTML, CSS, Javascript for starters.
This is a codebase for a t-shirt selling website which provides all the major functionality that an e-commerce application needs such as Product list, categories, cart, order, payment etc etc. These can be managed through admin portal of django.

In order to run this web app you need to have the [backend](https://github.com/nadeem099/Ecommerce-back-end) up and running.

## Get started
To get started you need to have npm installed in your system.

4) In your project directory run ```npm start```. (note: makesure your [backend](https://github.com/nadeem099/Ecommerce-back-end) is up and running)

## Status
Right now front end is terrible. I am working on it to make the gui better. If you want to contribute you are more than welcomed.
